# Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using https://github.com/SciML/MethodOfLines.jl, a finite difference method (FDM).

## Other PDE packages

- https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl and its [tutorials](https://github.com/gridap/Tutorials)
- https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl
- https://github.com/WaterLily-jl/WaterLily.jl for fluid dynamics.

## UDEs

Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) are hybrids of differential equations and neural networks.

- https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqFlux.jl : fusing differential equations (`DifferentialEquations.jl`) and neural networks (`Lux.jl`).
- https://github.com/SciML/NeuralPDE.jl : physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) Solvers, learning and building the equations from the ground up. `NeuralPDE.jl` is slower than `DiffEqFlux.jl`.
