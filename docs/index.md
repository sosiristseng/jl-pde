## Using neural networks to solve differential equations

Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) are hybrids of differential equations and neural networks.

- Universal Differential Equations (UDEs): https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqFlux.jl
- Physically-informed neural networks (PINNs): https://github.com/SciML/NeuralPDE.jl

`DiffEqFlux` is generally more efficient than `NeuralPDE` because `NeuralPDE` also tries to discover physical rules in the data, which is mentioned in [this thread](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/comparisons-between-julia-neuralpde-jl-and-diffeqflux-jl-and-deepxde-python-package/52669).
